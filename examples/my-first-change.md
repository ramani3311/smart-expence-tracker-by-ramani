# My First Git Change

This file demonstrates the Git workflow by making a simple change to the repository.

## What I'm Learning

Today I learned how to:
- [x] Clone a repository
- [x] Make changes to files
- [x] Use `git status` to check what changed
- [ ] Use `git add` to stage changes
- [ ] Use `git commit` to save changes
- [ ] Use `git push` to upload changes

## Practice Changes

Let me practice by adding some information about myself:

**Name:** [Add your name here]
**Date:** [Add today's date]
**Goal:** Learning Git and version control

## My First Code Change

Here's a simple JavaScript function I wrote:

```javascript
function greetLearner(name) {
    return `Hello ${name}! Welcome to learning Git!`;
}

// Test the function
console.log(greetLearner("Your Name"));
```

## Commit Message Practice

When I commit this file, I will use the message:
```
Add my first learning example with personal information
```

This follows the best practices:
- ✅ Descriptive and clear
- ✅ Uses present tense
- ✅ Starts with a capital letter
- ✅ Explains what the change does

## Next Steps

After creating this file, I will:
1. Check status: `git status`
2. Add the file: `git add examples/my-first-change.md`
3. Commit: `git commit -m "Add my first learning example with personal information"`
4. Push: `git push`
